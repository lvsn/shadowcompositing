# Shadow Harmonization for Realistic Compositing
This repository contains the official implementation of the SIGGRAPH Asia 2023 proceeding "Shadow Harmonization for Realistic Compositing." Code is available to train and test the network. Example scripts for object compositing, animation, rendering, and dataset generation are also included. Links for assets such as proposed datasets, pre-trained models, and Blender project files are listed below.

## Code Structure
The source code of this project can be found in the `src` directory. Within it, there are 4 separate sub-projects, as listed below. Each sub-project directory contains a separate README with the necessary specifics.
 - `docker`: contains the necessary scripts to create and run the Docker image used to train the network. For more information, see our [Docker README](https://github.com/lvsn/shadowcompositing/blob/main/src/docker/README.md).
 - `network`: contains the main source code for the deep generative pipeline. For more information, see the [Network README](https://github.com/lvsn/shadowcompositing/blob/main/src/network/README.md).
- `compositing`: contains demo examples of compositing two separate scenes (including the teaser image) as well as an animation example script (all image-based). There is also an example of how to render a scene that is suitable for our compositing code using Blender at `compositing/blender`. See **NOTE 1** for more information, as well as the [Compositing README](https://github.com/lvsn/shadowcompositing/blob/main/src/compositing/README.md).
- `city_shadows`: contains the generation and post-processing code to re-create our (publicly available) synthetic dataset. See **NOTE 2** for more information, as well as the [CityShadows README](https://github.com/lvsn/shadowcompositing/blob/main/src/city_shadows/README.md).

**NOTE 1:** All input for our test-time `compositing` examples is available as a user would achieve it manually. [FSpy](https://fspy.io/) is used for camera alignment (together with its [Blender add-on](https://github.com/stuffmatic/fSpy-Blender)) and [Blender's sky nodes](https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/latest/render/shader_nodes/textures/sky.html) are used for lighting estimation. This approach simplifies the required dependencies for a user to experiment with our code and addresses permission issues with proprietary implementations of automatic camera and lighting estimation networks.

**NOTE 2:** Blender assets are not included specifically for our `city_shadows` code due to licensing limitations with [SceneCity](http://www.cgchan.com/). Nonetheless, all our generation scripts are provided and can be used directly by SceneCity license owners. We further hope the scripts can also be useful by themselves, as they contain multiple snippets of Python code for Blender and Cycles, which can facilitate the creation of varied synthetic datasets.

For further questions, feel free to reach out using the previously-listed emails.

## Assets
The resources for this project should be placed in the `rsc` directory, as the scripts in `src` are configured to work with the provided directory structure. Within `rsc`, there are 3 directories:

 - `checkpoints`: directory for the pre-trained weights for our proposed models. Simply unzip `checkpoints.zip` into it. [The ZIP file can be downloaded here.](https://hdrdb-public.s3.valeria.science/shadowcompositing/checkpoints.zip)
 - `datasets`: directory for our training data, real and synthetic, including our proposed augmentations and ground truth annotations. Simply unzip `datasets.zip` into it. [The ZIP file can be downloaded here.](https://hdrdb-public.s3.valeria.science/shadowcompositing/datasets.zip)
 - `demo`: rendered layers for two separate scenes to be used for our compositing and animation examples. Also includes a sample Blender project with the necessary rendering setup and scripts. Simply unzip `demo.zip` into it. [The ZIP file can be downloaded here.](https://hdrdb-public.s3.valeria.science/shadowcompositing/demo.zip)
